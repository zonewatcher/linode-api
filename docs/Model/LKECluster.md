## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes

**id** | **int** | This Kubernetes cluster&#39;s unique ID. | [optional] [readonly]
**created** | **\DateTime** | When this Kubernetes cluster was created. | [optional] [readonly]
**updated** | **\DateTime** | When this Kubernetes cluster was updated. | [optional] [readonly]
**label** | **string** | This Kubernetes cluster&#39;s unique label for display purposes only. Labels have the following constraints:    * UTF-8 characters will be returned by the API using escape     sequences of their Unicode code points. For example, the     Japanese character *„Åã* is 3 bytes in UTF-8 (&#x60;0xE382AB&#x60;). Its     Unicode code point is 2 bytes (&#x60;0x30AB&#x60;). APIv4 supports this     character and the API will return it as the escape sequence     using six 1 byte characters which represent 2 bytes of Unicode     code point (&#x60;\&quot;\\u30ab\&quot;&#x60;).   * 4 byte UTF-8 characters are not supported.   * If the label is entirely composed of UTF-8 characters, the API     response will return the code points using up to 193 1 byte     characters. | [optional]
